<b>Phenotype to Genotype:</b>

Details of Folder Structure:
  1. target_correlation_matrix: Contains target correlation matrix based on different phenotypyes from phenotypic observations 
  2. SNP_outputs: Containing the list of SNPs (effective list provides the set giving highest correlation coeeficient).
  3. SNP_outputs_annotated: TSV expansion of SNP_outputs showing snpEff annotation information
  4. correlation_trend: Containining the plots depicting the correlation trend while adding SNPs
