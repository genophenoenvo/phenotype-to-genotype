#### Codes used in our experiments: ####
1. "extract_SNPs_SFS_on_GWAS": Extracts "significant" SNPs from the GWAS-filtered SNP sets and MAC Season 6 phenotype data.
2. "test_clemson_on_GWAS": Test Clemson phenotype dataset with the "significant" SNPs extracted by '1'.
3. "extract_SNPs_SFS_chrom_wise": Extracts "significant" SNPs considering all variants in each of the chromosome separtely and MAC Season 6 phenotype data.
4. "extract_SNPs_SFS_chrom_combined": Extracts final set of "significant" SNPs combining the "significant" SNPs extracted for each chromosome.  
5. "test_clemson_chrom_combined": Test Clemson phenotype dataset with the "significant" SNPs extracted by '4'.
6. "SNP_annotations": This is used to annotate the "signicant" SNPs to genes.
